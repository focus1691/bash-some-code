This is an action game intended to familiarise children with basic code syntax.

All the runtime dlls are included in the folder for gameplay.exe to be run directly.

The [SDL 2.0 library](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) is needed to manually install this game, along with the [GCC](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/latest/download?source=files). In addition, SDL 2's TTF library is needed.
