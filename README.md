This is an action game intended to familiarise children with basic code syntax. All the runtime dlls are included in the folder for gameplay.exe to be run directly.

**To manually install the game**, you need the [SDL 2.0 library](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php), along with the [GCC](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/latest/download?source=files). In addition, the [SDL 2 TTF library](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/) is needed.
