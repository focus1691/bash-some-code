## Introduction
This is an action game intended to familiarise children with basic code syntax. All the runtime dlls are included in the folder for gameplay.exe to be run directly.


## Manual Installation
To manually install the game, you need to download and install the [SDL 2.0 library](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php), along with the [GCC](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/latest/download?source=files). In addition, you need the [SDL 2.0 TTF library](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/). This [tutorial](http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/01_hello_SDL/windows/msvsnet2010u/index.php) by Lazy Foo shows you how to setup SDL 2.0.
